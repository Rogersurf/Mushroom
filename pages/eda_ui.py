            ## 1. Understand & Load the Dataset
                a. Load the Data into a Pandas DataFrame.
                b. Perform Initial Exploration - Head, Info, Describe, etc.
                c. Document Observations about Potential Issues and Patterns.    
            ## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
                ### a. Visual Exploration:
                    - Use Altair to visualize the distribution of each variable.
                    - Use color to distinguish between the target classes.
                    - For categorical features, visualize proportions for each category.
                ### b. Statistical Exploration:
                    - For each categorical feature, perform Chi-square tests to understand dependency with the target variable.
            ## 3. Data Preprocessing
                - Handle Anomalies and Outliers if any.
                - Encode Categorical Features and Target Variable.
                - Handle Missing Values if any.
            ## 4. Feature Importance & Selection
                - Use Mutual Information to Measure Dependency between Each Feature and the Target.
                - Based on Mutual Information, Chi-square Tests, and Domain Knowledge, Select Features that will be Used in the Model.
            ## 5. Modeling
                ### a. Decision Tree:
                    - Use a Decision Tree Classifier as an exploratory tool to understand the impact of different features on the target variable.
                    - Visualize the Decision Tree.
            ## 6. Hypothesis Testing
                - Formulate Specific Hypotheses Based on EDA Findings.
                - Use Appropriate Statistical Tests to Test the Hypotheses.
                - Document the Results of Hypothesis Testing, Including any Impact on Model Selection or Feature Engineering.
            ## 7. Model Evaluation
                - If the Project's Goal Includes Building a Predictive Model, Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets.
                - Train the Chosen Model(s) and Evaluate its Performance using Appropriate Metrics.
                - Discuss the Implications of the Model's Performance.
